Collex Main Website
--------------------------------------

This is the user-facing website for collex. You will need this if you are 
setting up your own instance of Collex. After downloading this, you will have 
to customize it for your own look and feel. You can then either arrange
to have your own documents added to the ARC Federation, or you can create a 
completely stand alone version of this site. If you do the former, then this is
the only project in the collex tool chain that you need to set up yourself. 
It is recommended that you also use the collex_wordpress_theme project, though. 
If you are setting up a stand-alone site, you will need all the projects.

--------------------------------------
Collex architecture

Collex is a complex project made up of a number of subprojects that all have to
be in place for it to work. Most users will probably just need to set up the 
main Collex piece and point it at the existing Catalog. If that is all you want
to do, then you don't need to understand the following architecture and you 
don't need to download the "solr" or "catalog" projects.

When Collex is deployed, it is branded with the name of a particular 
"Federation", like NINES or 18thConnect. The website that the end user goes to 
will look like that federation, but the code behind it is the "collex" 
project here.

When a search is done from "collex", the request is made to the "catalog" 
project, which is a web service that exposes all the documents that have been 
stored.

The "catalog" webservice processes the request and forms the correct call to 
the "solr" webservice.

The "arc-inbox" is a simple website that allows users to upload new .rdf 
content that will be added to the catalog / solr index.

The documents are added to the solr index by converting RDF documents using 
the project "rdf-indexer".

The About section of "collex" and the News section of "collex" are two separate
WordPress installations. The recommended theme to use is in the 
"collex_wordpress_theme" project.

The "typewright" project can be attached to a "collex" instance if you wish by 
setting it up in the site.yml file of "collex". The "typewright" project is a 
webservice that keeps the information about all the typewright-enabled
documents. The actual web presence of typewright is in the "collex" project 
under subfolders named typewright.

--------------------------------------
Deployment

1) Download this project to your local development area.
2) Copy config/database.example.yml to config/database.yml.
3) Copy config/site.example.yml to config/site.yml.
4) Modify those two files to suit your server and your needs. There are comments in them. 
   ** DO NOT CHECK THEM IN! **
5) The first time you run, you will have to run "bundle install".
6) Collex is deployed using capistrano, and can be deployed to either
   a staging server (edge) or a production server. The configuration for each
   host is found in config/site.yml at the bottom of the file. Fill
   in the necessary data for each site. To complete this section, you
   must have a user created on the target host which will run the catalog.
   That user must have full read/write permissions on the install directory.
   Additionally you must generate an ssh key-pair on your development machine and
   install it on the target host. Add an entry in your ~/.ssh/config file for
   each host. Example:
   
   Host edge-collex
       Hostname 128.128,128,128
       User collex
       Port 22
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/edge-collex
       
   To begin the deplyment, run "cap menu"
