<blockquote><i>Since the first publication of this chapter, many
of its recommendations have been rendered obsolete or obsolescent by
the development of ISO/IEC 10646 and the adoption of Unicode as the
underlying character set for all XML documents. The chapter has 
undergone considerable revision to reflect these changes, but further
substantial change is likely in the next release of these
Guidelines.</i></blockquote>

<p>
<a name="id2753047"></a>Computer systems vary greatly in the sets of characters they make
available for use in electronic documents; this variety enables users
with widely different needs to find computer systems suitable to their
purposes, but it also complicates the interchange of documents among
systems; hence the need for a chapter on this topic in these Guidelines.
 </p>

<p>In the absence of any generally agreed universal character set,
creators of electronic documents have constantly faced such problems as:

</p>
<ol>
<li>selecting which character set to use in creating, processing, or
storing the electronic text</li>
<li>preparing documents for interchange so that the characters
within them are not corrupted in transit</li>
<li>encoding characters which are not provided by the character
set available on the computer system in use at one or other end of the
interchange</li>
<li>indicating shifts from one character set to another, e.g. from
the Latin alphabet to Greek and back, or to a special symbol character
set and back</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="id2753117"></a>Over the last two decades of the twentieth century, it became
increasingly clear that a unified character set, able to accomodate
all languages and scripts used in the world, would be not only
desirable, but also feasible.  With the formation of the Unicode
Consortium and the development of the Unicode Standard, later
synchronized with the work of the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) which lead to the definition of ISO 10646, it
became possible to speak of a <a name="TDX-155"></a><em>universal character set</em>,
and thus to solve all of the problems listed above for the vast
majority of users. </p>

<p>
<a name="id2753141"></a>With the availability of a Universal Character Set, users no longer
need to select different character sets for different languages or
applications; when documents are prepared for interchange, the usage
of the universal character set ensures that characters will not be
corrupted in transit, and that the same characters will be available
at either end of the interchange; and lastly, there is no need to
shift between different character sets within a single document.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2753157"></a>For some of the materials which users of these Guidelines are
likely to want to process (notably, ancient texts using little-known
writing systems) the simplest ways of using the Universal Character
Set may not be applicable. Nevertheless, it provides a more reliable
and comprehensive mechanism for processing materials using such
writing systems than any hitherto available.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2753171"></a>In this chapter we first describe informally the model of character
encoding which underlies modern computing systems. We next describe
how present-day encoding systems can benefit from the advent of
Unicode, particularly in the XML context, and make recommendations for
its use by the TEI community. We also discuss issues relating to
continued use of SGML legacy data.
</p>


<div class="teidiv">
<h4>
<a name="index-div2-id2753184"></a>4.1  A simple character encoding model</h4>

<div class="teidiv">
<h5>
<a name="index-div3-id2753204"></a>4.1.1  Some definitions</h5>

<p>
<a name="id2751086"></a>The term <a name="TDX-156"></a><em>character</em> has several meanings which it is
necessary to keep distinct for a proper understanding of the issues
which arise in representing texts in digital form. At the risk of
insulting the intelligence of the expert reader, we will attempt to
disentangle some of those meanings here.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note47"><sup>47</sup></a>
</p> 

<p>
<a name="id2751158"></a>We use the term <a name="TDX-157"></a><em>abstract character</em> to refer to the
atomic component of some writing system, independent of how it is
realized in some written form, and also of how it is stored in some
digital form. For example, we might use the letter A to stand for the
same abstract character (capital letter roman A), whatever font is
used to render it, and whatever pattern of bits is used to represent
it in digital storage. A character is an inherently abstract notion:
it corresponds with `the smallest unit that carries semantic
value' within some writing system. </p> 

<p>
<a name="id2751187"></a>A given computer system will usually be configured to support a
fixed number of abstract characters, which we call its <a name="TDX-158"></a><em>character
repertoire</em>.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2751203"></a>We use the term <a name="TDX-159"></a><em>glyph</em> to refer to the particular
written form used for an abstract character when it is rendered on
screen or paper, and the term <a name="TDX-160"></a><em>font</em> for a particular set
of glyphs. The same character may be represented by many different
glyphs; less obviously, the same glyph, may in certain circumstances
correspond with different abstract characters, or be used with
different interpretations, as when, for example, the Greek capital
letter omega is also used to represent the unit of electrical
resistance (ohm).  </p>

<p>When dealing with historical material, it may be a matter of some
debate as to whether some glyph should be regarded as a variant of the
same abstract character or as a different character.  For example, in
early printed texts the lowercase roman letter S may appear in an
elongated form. Should this be treated as a distinct abstract
character (itself with variant glyphs) or simply as a variant glyph
for the abstract character represented also by the non-elongated form?
Some relevant questions to ask are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the elongated form of the s ever contrast with the non-elongated
form in the same document with a different meaning? If so, it should be
handled as a separate character.</li>
<li>Could the two forms be interchanged without affecting the
meaning of a document? If so, they should be regarded as variant glyphs.</li>
<li>Does one of the forms appear in a predictable context (for example
only in a particular position in a word)? If so,
it might be a variant glyph, rather than a distinct character.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="id2751288"></a>Because historical materials are often fragmentary and idiosyncratic
in their appearance, the decision as to whether a sign is a character
or variant may be a matter of debate. It is also a decision which
changes over time: it might be argued, for example, that the letters U
and V, which are now regarded as distinct, were at one time variant
glyphs for the same abstract character in the Latin writing
system. However such issues are handled, they should be carried
through consistently and adequately documented.



</p>

<p>
<a name="id2751312"></a>We use the term <a name="TDX-161"></a><em>coded character set</em> (strictly) to mean
the set of numeric values associated with a given character repertoire
when it is represented in digital form.  For example, in some
character code, the abstract character A might be represented by the
number 31, B by the number 32, and so on. Each of these mappings (from
abstract character to number) is sometimes called a <a name="TDX-162"></a><em>code
point</em>. A number of other phrases are sometimes used in place of
`coded character set', including <a name="TDX-163"></a><em>character
code</em> or <a name="TDX-164"></a><em>character set</em>, and the same phrase is also
often used as a synonym for both font and repertoire, as we have
defined them here.  Our usage follows common practice within both ISO
and W3C.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note48"><sup>48</sup></a> </p>

<p>
<a name="id2751377"></a>Note also that a given abstract character may be represented by
   more than one code point, or by a sequence of code points. For
   example, the single abstract character ä corresponds with code
   point 244 in the Universal Character Set, but also with the
   sequence of code points 31 and 104, which stand for the letter a and
   the diaresis symbol respectively.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note49"><sup>49</sup></a> </p>

<p>
<a name="id2751421"></a>Finally, we use the term <a name="TDX-167"></a><em>encoded character</em> to mean
simply the numerical value associated with that abstract character in
a given coded character set.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note50"><sup>50</sup></a>  </p>

<p>
<a name="id2751463"></a>The character encoding (i.e. the representation used for its
   encoded characters) applicable to an XML document is stated in its
   encoding declaration (<a class="ptr" href="SG.html#SG181">2.10.1 SGML and XML declarations</a>) and is UTF8 or UTF16
   by default. These Guidelines do not recommend usage of other
   character encodings for XML documents.  The encoding applicable to an SGML document is defined
   (along with other matters) in the SGML declaration prefixed to it
   and is almost entirely arbitrary.</p>

</div>
<div class="teidiv">
<h5>
<a name="index-div3-id2751494"></a>4.1.2  Characters and glyphs</h5>

<p>Both the Unicode standard and ISO/IEC 10646 give 
fundamentally similar definitions for the terms <a name="TDX-168"></a><em>character</em> and
<a name="TDX-169"></a><em>glyph</em> along the lines we have informally introduced
above. The ISO definitions are as follows: </p>
<p><dl>
<dt><strong>character</strong></dt>
<dd>A member
of a set of elements used for the organisation,
control, or representation of data. (ISO/IEC
10646-1: 1993, 31)</dd>
<dt><strong>glyph</strong></dt>
<dd>A recognizable abstract graphic symbol which
is independent of any specific design. (ISO/IEC
9541-1: 1991, 3.5)</dd>
</dl></p>
<p></p>

<p>Here are the Unicode definitions: </p>
<p><dl>
<dt><strong>character</strong></dt>
<dd>(1) The smallest component
of written language that has semantic value; refers to the abstract
meaning and/or shape, rather than a specific shape (see also <a name="TDX-170"></a><em>glyph</em>),
though in code tables some form of visual representation is essential
for the reader's understanding. (2) Synonym for abstract
character. (See Definition D3 in Section 3.3, <i>Characters and
Coded Representations</i>) (3) The basic unit of encoding for the
Unicode character encoding. (4) The English name for the ideographic
written elements of Chinese origin. </dd>
<dt><strong>glyph</strong></dt>
<dd>(1) An abstract form that represents one or
more glyph images. (2) A synonym for glyph image. In displaying
Unicode character data, one or more glyphs may be selected to depict a
particular character. These glyphs are selected by a rendering engine
during composition and layout processing.  (See also <a name="TDX-171"></a><em>character</em>.)
</dd>
<dt><strong>glyph image</strong></dt>
<dd>The actual, concrete image of
a glyph representation having been rasterized or otherwise imaged onto
some display surface.  </dd>
</dl></p>
<p> Although representative glyphs
do appear in Unicode character tables as an aid to the reader, it is
important to note that these are not normative; the Unicode Standard
defines characters, as defined above, and not glyphs.</p>

<p>These may be compared with the following related, partially
overlapping definitions, used in the field of linguistic theory (See for
example <a name="index-bibl-id2751681"></a>R. R. K. Hartmann and F.C. Stork:
<i>Dictionary of language and
linguistics</i>, Applied Science Publishers
Ltd., London,  1976)</p>
<p><dl>
<dt><strong>grapheme</strong></dt>
<dd>A minimally distinctive
unit of a particular writing system. The different
variants, e.g., the cursive and printed shapes of
letters M, m, cursivated m, M, etc. in an alphabetic
writings system are all allographs of the grapheme
/m/.</dd>
<dt><strong>allograph</strong></dt>
<dd> One of a
group of variants of a grapheme or written sign in a
particular writing system. It usually refers to
different shapes of letters and punctuation marks,
e.g., lower case, capital, cursive, printed,
strokes.</dd>
</dl></p>
<p> 

While `glyph' and `allograph'
seem almost synonymous, it should be noted that
`grapheme' is defined with reference to a
particular writing system, whereas an `abstract
character' is defined independently of any specific writing
system.  </p>


<p>
<a name="id2751771"></a>The distinction between characters and glyphs is crucial in
preparing an encoded text. Users of such texts expect systems to
recognize different glyphs as representing the same character when
(for example) performing text retrieval or text searching; at the same
time, they expect characters to be rendered using appropriate
glyphs. When encoding a pre-existing text, the encoder must therefore
determine whether a particular letter or symbol is a character or a
glyphic variant of one.  A coherent model of the relationship between
characters and glyphs has been developed within the Unicode Consortium
and the ISO working group SC2<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note51"><sup>51</sup></a> and will form the base for
much future standards work.</p>

<p>The model makes explicit the distinction between two different
properties of the components of written language:</p>
<ul>
<li>their content, i.e. its meaning and phonetic value (represented
by a character)</li>
<li>their graphical appearance (represented by a glyph)</li>
</ul>
<p></p> 

<p>
<a name="id2751843"></a>When searching for information, a system generally operates on the
content aspects of characters, usually with little attention paid to their appearance
of characters.  A layout or formatting procedure on the other hand,
has little to do with the content, but needs to be concerned with the
exact appearance of characters.  Of course, many operations require
attention to both kinds of feature (hyphenation for example), but in
general the kind of text encoding described in these Guidelines tends
to focus on content rather than appearance (see further <a class="ptr" href="CO.html#COHQ">6.3 Highlighting and Quotation</a>).  </p> 

<p>When the purpose of an encoding is to represent information about which glyphs
were used in some instance of the document being treated, one might choose
to do so at either or both of two levels: </p>
<ul>
<li>on the level of character encoding, e.g. with
appropriate Unicode code points.</li>
<li>on the markup level,
with appropriate elements and/or attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
It should be noted that using `appropriate Unicode code points' to
represent glyph information requires that such choices be documented in
the TEI Header or WSD. Such documentation does not guarantee proper
display of the desired glyph but at least makes the intention of the
encoder discoverable.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2751919"></a>At present, neither the Unicode Standard nor these Guidelines offer
detailed specifications for the encoding of glyph variations.  Some
discussion of related matters is given in <a class="ptr" href="PH.html">18 Transcription of Primary Sources</a>, and the
writing system declaration (<a class="ptr" href="WD.html">25 Writing System Declaration</a>) offers some features
for the definition of variant glyphs, but further work is needed in
both these areas before detailed recommendations can be made.  </p>


</div>

<div class="teidiv">
<h5>
<a name="CHIN"></a>4.1.3  Characters and their encoding</h5>

<p>
<a name="id2751982"></a>Over the years, many different ways of encoding abstract characters
have been proposed by national standard bodies and vendors of
information processing systems, often derived from the sometimes
limited character repertoires available on specific kinds of
hardware.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note52"><sup>52</sup></a>
</p>


<p>
<a name="id2752042"></a>Because of this variety, at the time these Guidelines were first published (1994) 
no single character set could plausibly be recommended for use in TEI-encoded
documents.  It was felt at that time that users would have to use
whatever character sets were available to them, subject
to the character set restrictions imposed by the SGML declaration.
For texts subject to
`blind' interchange (that is, interchange between
parties who do not or cannot make explicit agreements over the character
set to be used in interchange), users would have to rely on a small
subset of the available character repertoires which could be reliably
transported across networks.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note53"><sup>53</sup></a>
At that time, also, the character encoding used by an SGML document
could be redefined by the SGML declaration: this was necessary, since
it would otherwise have been impossible to interchange SGML documents
using different encodings.  </p>

<p>
<a name="id2752101"></a>With the advent of XML, and the definition of Unicode, the job of
those wishing to encode arbitrary character repertoires becomes very
much simpler. The Unicode standard<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note54"><sup>54</sup></a> defines the
Universal Character Set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous
encoding for the content of plain text, ultimately covering all
languages.  Currently in its third major version, Unicode provides
coverage for most of the world's writing systems. It also
contains additional characters for interoperability with older
character encodings, and characters with control-like functions
included primarily for reasons of providing unambiguous interpretation
of plain text. Unicode provides specifications for use of all of these
characters.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2752166"></a>Users of these Guidelines are strongly recommended to make
themselves familiar with the general principles of Unicode, as spelled
out in <i>The Unicode Standard Version
3.0</i>, Chapter 2.  Additionally, there is an excellent document
co-published by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Unicode
Consortium, <i>Unicode in XML and other Markup
Languages</i>.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note55"><sup>55</sup></a>
which gives some general considerations, and specific usage
suggestions.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2752227"></a>We have stated several times above (<a class="ptr" href="SG.html#SG-cer">2.7.3 Character references</a>) that
all XML documents use the same character encoding: this is the Universal Character
Set defined by ISO/IEC 10646, which is effectively the same as 
the character encoding defined by the Unicode consortium.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note56"><sup>56</sup></a>
Strictly speaking, these are both character encodings and 
character repertoires, since each of them defines both a set of abstract
characters and the code points corresponding with them. </p>

<p>
<a name="id2756132"></a>It should be stressed again that Unicode represents `abstract characters'
independent of specific glyph forms: the glyph examples
given in Unicode code charts are not normative, being chosen simply to
indicate which character is intended.  There is no guarantee
that a given character encoded with a given Unicode
codepoint will be rendered in a similar way on different
computer systems, because information about which glyph from
which glyph collection is to be used is simply not encoded, and
is therefore not available for any rendering process.

<p>
<a name="id2756156"></a>Although it may be tempting to specify a glyph guided by its particular
appearance in a font, users should be aware that font repertoires
may vary; what one system displays may not necessarily appear the same
to someone using a different font. Hence, just relying on character
encoding and the font may not be sufficient and a comment in the WSD or
TEI header should be included, specifying the exact nature of the intended
glyph.

<p>
<a name="id2756177"></a>The code space for Unicode characters allows for around one
million characters.  These characters are organized as 17
`planes', each of which holds up to 65&#8200;536
codepoints.  Only the first of these planes, the `Basic
Multilingual Plane' (BMP) can be addressed (or represented)
using a single 16 bit integer; for all other planes two 16 bit
integers are required. Unicode 3.1 has assigned codepoints beyond the
BMP for the first time, but most characters can be addressed using
just the BMP. </p>

<a name="index-div3-id2756207"></a>4.1.4  Character semantics</h5>

<p>
<a name="id2756226"></a>In addition to the Universal Character Set itself, the Unicode
Consortium maintains a database of additional character semantics.
This includes names for each character codepoint and normative
properties for it.  This database is an important reference in
determining which Unicode codepoint to use to encode a certain
character. In addition to the printed documentation and lists made
available by the Unicode consortium, it may also be accessed by a
number of search systems over the web (e.g. <a href="http://www.eki.ee/letter/" target="_top" class="quicklink"><span>http://www.eki.ee/letter/</span></a>). Examples of character
properties included in the database include <a name="TDX-172"></a><em>case</em>,
<a name="TDX-173"></a><em>numeric value</em>, <a name="TDX-174"></a><em>directionality</em>, and its
status as a `compatibility character'.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note57"><sup>57</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="id2756316"></a>The existence of compatability and composed characters means that,
with the best will in the world, there will still remain a number of
characters that have more than one encoding in Unicode.  In addition
to characters composed from a base character and some diacritical
marks, Unicode also contains quite a number of `precomposed
characters'. Most of these were already encoded in earlier
standards that served as sources for Unicode; in principle, no
further precomposed characters are to be added.  A sequence of a
base character and one or more diacritical marks is supposed to be
equivalent to the corresponding precomposed character; yet both are
present. In the same way, different allographic forms of the same
underlying ideograph may sometimes be regarded as distinct Unicode
characters.  </p>

<p>
<a name="id2756345"></a>It is important to treat such variation
in a consistent and normalized way. Where, for a particular project,
these multiple character representations are regarded as equivalent, data integrity
requires that the project standardize on one form and document its
decision.  The Unicode Consortium provides four standard
normalization forms, <a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note58"><sup>58</sup></a> of which the Normalization Form C (NFC)
seems to be most appropriate for
text encoding projects.  The World Wide
Web Consortium has produced a document entitled <i>Character Model
for the World Wide Web 1.0</i>, <a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note59"><sup>59</sup></a> which among other things outlines some
principles of normalization.  In general, normalization to the
shortest possible Unicode encoding is recommended. </p>

<h5>
<a name="index-div3-id2756434"></a>4.1.5  Characters from the Private Usage Area</h5>


<p>
<a name="id2756454"></a>Although Unicode has already assigned more than 94&#8200;000 characters
    to unique codepoints, there is always the possibility that
    characters needed are not defined in Unicode.
    Some of these may be presentation forms or alternate writing
    styles of East Asian characters that do not qualify to be included
    in Unicode.  For such characters, Unicode provides a
    `Private Usage Area', which is reserved for use
    by vendors, private groups, and individuals.  There are 6400
    codepoints in this area in the BMP and 131&#8200;068 in other
    planes.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2756478"></a>By definition, the codepoints in this range are of use only
    internally. Their use in TEI documents intended for interchange is
    therefore <em>strongly discouraged</em>.  Where encoders need
    to interchange non-Unicode characters, they should do so by other
    mechanisms, for example by named character entity references,
    supported by appropriate documentation, for example in a WSD. </p>

<p>
<a name="id2756499"></a>For local processing, on the other hand, use of characters from
this area might prove convenient, since, if the corresponding font
resources are available, users can see the characters more
easily on their screens and analytical software might not be able to
process entity references in the same way as characters.  In any case,
before preparing a TEI document for interchange, all occurrences of
characters from the Private Usage Area should be removed.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2756514"></a>As a concrete example, supposing that we wished to render the
elongated s (or any other glyph variant) in a distinct way in our
local processing environment, we might conveniently assign some
codepoint from the PUA for this purpose (say, U+E000). This would then
make it possible to create a font that displays the desired character
at this codepoint.  However, since this assignment would only be valid
on the local site, any texts containing such codepoints would not be
suitable for interchange until they have been re-encoded, for example
by substituting a character entity reference (such as
<tt>&amp;long-s;</tt>) for each occurrence of U+E000. When
received at some other site, the character entity reference could
again be resolved to a code point from the PUA.  If (as is possible)
the receiving site has already assigned some other use for the
codepoint U+E000, it can simply choose some other hitherto unused
codepoint (say, U+E080) to represent the same variant glyph.  (On
character entity references, see <a class="ptr" href="CH.html#CH-ent">4.2.1 Character input and entity references</a> below).</p>

<h4>
<a name="CHLON"></a>4.2  Entry and display of characters</h4>

<p>
<a name="id2756579"></a>So far we have largely been concerned with the advantages of using
a single character encoding for the storage and representation of
data. At the time of writing (2002), Unicode-aware
software is becoming increasingly common, as the ideas of Unicode
find ready acceptance in the networked world. Nevertheless, there will
continue for some time to be a need for guidance on how to input and
display Unicode data using non-Unicode-aware systems, just as there will
always need to be a way of entering and displaying non-Unicode
characters. The methods developed to cope with the pre-Unicode world
of multiple character sets can helpfully be re-applied to address
these problems.</p>

<div class="teidiv">
<h5>
<a name="CH-ent"></a>4.2.1  Character input and entity references</h5>
<p>
<a name="id2756621"></a>Data characters can be included in an XML document directly, by
typing them in from a keyboard, or indirectly by representing them by
means of entity references. When characters are typed in directly, the software
used can be configured in a variety of ways to simplify the task of
entering characters not immediately visible on the keyboard (for
example, by using special keyboard shortcuts,
<a name="TDX-176"></a><em>escape sequences</em>, onscreen virtual keyboards, etc.);
these are not described in any detail here, as they are so
environment-dependent. For example, if  the character  Ä
is not directly available from the 
keyboard, and if one is using a machine running Windows, one might enter it
by  holding down the ALT key and typing the digits 0196 on the
numeric keyboard. Alternatively, on a system such as Gnu
Emacs, one might define a sequence of keystrokes such as <tt>A&quot;</tt>
to have the same effect.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2756654"></a>When characters are represented using <a name="TDX-177"></a><em>entity
references</em> (described in more detail in section <a class="ptr" href="SG.html#SG17">2.7 Entities</a>), the reference may be given as a numeric entity
reference, using either decimal or hexadecimal notation, or it may be
given as a standardized name. For example, the character Ä might be
represented by any of the three following entity references
<tt>&amp;#196; &amp;#x00C4; &amp;Auml;</tt>. The first two
represent the character required by means of its code point value (196
in decimal, C4 in hexadecimal) in the Unicode character code: they are
thus entirely self-sufficient, and can be processed directly by any
Unicode-aware system; they are not however as attractive for human
beings, who generally find names more memorable than numbers. In the
third case above, the name <tt>Auml</tt> is taken from a
widely-used <a name="TDX-178"></a><em>entity set</em> called ISO Latin 1. An entity set is simply a list of
entity declarations in which parts of some character repertoire are
defined as entities with memorable names or mnemonics, with values
taken from an appropriate character encoding. For example, the XML version of the iso-lat1 entity set includes the
following declaration <tt>&lt;!ENTITY Auml &quot;&amp;#x00C4;&quot;&gt;</tt>. 
<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note60"><sup>60</sup></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="id2756750"></a>If entering the following text, 
<blockquote>Trotz dieser langen Tradition 
 sekundäranalytischer
 Ansätze wird man die Bilanz tatsächlich
 durchgeführter sekundäranalytischer Arbeiten
 aber in wesentlichen Punkten als unbefriedigend
 empfinden müssen.</blockquote>
in a system which does not allow for direct representation of  a-umlaut or u-umlaut, one
could transcribe this sentence thus:
<pre class="eg">Trotz dieser langen Tradition sekund&amp;auml;ranalytischer
 Ans&amp;auml;tze wird man die Bilanz tats&amp;auml;chlich
 durchgef&amp;uuml;hrter sekund&amp;auml;ranalytischer Arbeiten
 aber in wesentlichen Punkten als unbefriedigend
 empfinden m&amp;uuml;ssen.</pre>



 </p>
<p>
<a name="id2756798"></a>Before an entity can be referred to, it must be declared.  Standard
public entity names can be declared en masse, by including within the
DTD subset of the document a reference to the standard public
entity which declares them.  The German document quoted above, for
example, might have the following lines, or their equivalent, in its
DTD subset:
<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY % ISOLat1 PUBLIC 
      &quot;-//TEI//ENTITIES Unicode values for ISO 8879 Added Latin 1//EN&quot;
      &quot;http://www.tei-c.org/XML_Entities/iso-lat1.ent&quot;&gt;
 %ISOLat1;</pre>
 </p>
<p>
<a name="id2756821"></a>Such mechanisms are obviously unnecessary for the treatment of
characters such as a-umlaut or u-umlaut which are readily available in
Unicode. However, they may also be used for the representation of
other characters which are not yet standardized but which an encoder
wishes to distinguish. Such characters can be represented within a
document by any arbitrary entity name, which the encoder can then
associate with different expansions depending on the software system
or application involved. </p>
<p>
<a name="id2756838"></a>For example, in transcribing a manuscript, it might be desirable to distinguish
among three distinct forms of the letter &#8216;r&#8217;. In the
transcript, each of these forms will be encoded by an entity
reference, for example: <tt>&amp;r1;</tt>, <tt>&amp;r2;</tt>, and
<tt>&amp;r3;</tt>.  Entity declarations must then be
provided within the DTD subset of the document to define these
entities and specify a substitute string.
</p>
<p>
<a name="id2756870"></a>One possible set of declarations would be as follows:
 
<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY r  'r[1]'&gt;
&lt;!-- most common form of 'r'  --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r2 'r[2]'&gt;
&lt;!-- secondary form of 'r'    --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r3 'r[3]'&gt;
&lt;!-- third form of 'r'        --&gt;</pre>
 
The expansions shown above will simply flag each occurrence with a
number in brackets to indicate which form of &#8216;r&#8217;
appears in the manuscript.
 </p>
<p>
<a name="id2756897"></a>More realistically, we may be able to associate each of the variant
forms found with some predefined Unicode character. For example,
assuming that r1 represents an r with a dot above it, r2 represents an
r with a tail, and r3 represents an r with a fish-hook, we could
simply use the appropriate Unicode values as follows:
<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY r1  '&amp;#x1e59;'&gt;    &lt;!-- r with dot above  --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r2 '&amp;#x027d;'&gt;     &lt;!-- r with tail       --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r3 '&amp;#x027e;'&gt;     &lt;!-- r with fish-hook  --&gt;</pre>








 
 
Obviously, this will only have the desired effect if a font containing
the required glyphs is available when the document is rendered. If
rendering the glyphs requires some special processing action,
it may be preferable to use a processing instruction (<a class="ptr" href="SG.html#SG-pi">2.9.1 Processing instructions</a>) as  the replacement value for the entity, as in the
following example:

<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY r2  '&lt;?tex \specialR?&gt;'&gt;
     &lt;!-- when processing with TeX, use the \specialR command --&gt;
</pre>
If, on the other hand, the three kinds of r are being distinguished
     for some other kind of reason, perhaps to count their relative
     frequencies, with no particular concern as to how they are
     rendered, it might be preferable to convey the distinction by
     tagging them explicitly. In such a case, the replacement text for
     the three entities might look like the following:
<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY r  '&lt;c type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;r&lt;/c&gt;'&gt;
&lt;!-- most common form of 'r'  --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r2 '&lt;c type=&quot;2&quot;&gt;r&lt;/c&gt;'&gt;
&lt;!-- secondary form of 'r'    --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r3 '&lt;c type=&quot;3&quot;&gt;r&lt;/c&gt;'&gt;
&lt;!-- third form of 'r'        --&gt;</pre>

</p>
<p>
<a name="id2757003"></a>Finally, if the intention is for all three forms to be treated
alike, we might supply declarations like the following:
<pre class="eg">&lt;!ENTITY r  'r'&gt;
&lt;!-- most common form of 'r'  --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r2 'r'&gt;
&lt;!-- secondary form of 'r'    --&gt;
 &lt;!ENTITY r3 'r'&gt;
&lt;!-- third form of 'r'        --&gt;</pre>
 </p>
 








 


 

<p>
<a name="id2757072"></a>When locally defined entities are used for the representation of
characters in the text, for example to record presentational variants as
in this example,  a writing system declaration (<a class="ptr" href="WD.html">25 Writing System Declaration</a>) should be used to
document their meaning.

<h5>
<a name="index-div3-id2757094"></a>4.2.2  Transliteration schemes</h5>
<p>
<a name="id2757113"></a>For lengthy transcriptions in scripts not supported by the document
    character set,
entity references may prove unwieldy.  In such cases, it is also
possible to <a name="TDX-179"></a><em>transliterate</em> the material. In a
transliteration scheme, glyphs properly associated with one abstract
character are systematically redefined with another: for example, a
glyph which `looks like' an A (but is not in fact
an A) might be transliterated as one. To avoid information loss, a
<a name="TDX-180"></a><em>reversible</em> transliteration scheme (i.e. one in which it
is possible to reconstruct the original writing from the
transliteration) should be preferred.  <a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note61"><sup>61</sup></a> </p>

<p>
<a name="id2757181"></a>For example, using the Beta code transcription developed for
ancient Greek by the Thesaurus Linguæ Græcæ,<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note62"><sup>62</sup></a> one would transcribe the start of the
<i>Iliad</i> of Homer thus:

 OU)LOME/NHN, H(\ MURI/' *)AXAIOI=S A)/LGE' E)/QHKE,&lt;/l&gt;</pre>


 </p>
<p>
<a name="id2757258"></a>In an XML context, there is no particular reason to
 use a transliteration scheme, other than
 convenience of text preparation or the handling of legacy systems. If used, the transliteration scheme
 should be documented using a Writing System Declaration (<a class="ptr" href="WD.html">25 Writing System Declaration</a>). However, texts encoded using transliteration
 schemes are inherently non-standard, and the use of such schemes is
 thus deprecated except where circumstances permit no alternative.

<h4>
<a name="CHSH"></a>4.3  Code shifting</h4>

<p>
<a name="id2757308"></a>Linguists use the term <a name="TDX-181"></a><em>code shifting</em> for the practice,
common in many languages, of switching from one human language (such
as French) to another (such as Kreol) within the speech of a single
speaker. Many written documents also contain material from more than
one language: loan words, quotations from foreign languages, etc.
Since languages use a variety of <a name="TDX-182"></a><em>writing systems</em>, which
in turn use a variety of <a name="TDX-183"></a><em>character repertoires</em>, shifts in
language frequently go hand in hand with shifts in character
repertoire and writing system.  With the use of Unicode, a change in
writing system or human language will not generally require any
change in character encoding system; nevertheless, since language
change is frequently of importance in meaningful processing of a
document, the encoding scheme defined here provides a global attribute
<tt><b>lang</b></tt> to make it possible to mark language shifts
explicitly.  </p>

<p>
<a name="id2757358"></a>Some languages use more than one writing system.  For example, some
Slavic languages may be written either in the Latin or in the Cyrillic
alphabet; some Turkic languages in Cyrillic, Latin, or Arabic script.
In such cases, each writing system must be treated separately, as a
separate `language'.  Each distinct value of the
<tt><b>lang</b></tt> attribute, therefore, represents both a single natural
language and a single writing system.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note63"><sup>63</sup></a> </p>

<p>
<a name="id2757416"></a>Each value used for the <tt><b>lang</b></tt> attribute corresponds with
the identifier of a <a name="GDX-113"></a><b><tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt></b> element defined in the
<a name="GDX-114"></a><b><tt>&lt;langUsage&gt;</tt></b> element of the header of the TEI document concerned
(see <a class="ptr" href="HD.html#HD41">5.4.2 Language Usage</a>). This <a name="GDX-115"></a><b><tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt></b> element may
additionally reference a writing system declaration, using its
<tt><b>wsd</b></tt> attribute.  The values may be taken from the two- or
three-letter standard language codes defined by ISO-639:1988 or ISO
639-2:1998 respectively<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note64"><sup>64</sup></a> or, if there is no applicable language code
in the ISO 639 family of standards, from other appropriate lists of
language identifiers.<a class="notelink" href="index-notes.html#Note65"><sup>65</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
<a name="id2757549"></a>Like any global attribute, the <tt><b>lang</b></tt> attribute may be used
on any element in the document.  To mark a technical term, for
example, as being in a particular language, one may simply specify the
appropriate language on the <a name="GDX-116"></a><b><tt>&lt;term&gt;</tt></b> element
(for which see <a class="ptr" href="CO.html#COHQU">6.3.4 Terms, Glosses, and Cited Words</a>):
<pre class="eg">&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; ...
But then only will there be good ground of hope for the
further advance of knowledge, when there shall be received
and gathered together into natural history a variety of
experiments, which are of no use in themselves, but simply
serve to discover causes and axioms, which I call
&lt;term lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;Experimenta lucifera&lt;/term&gt;, experiments of
&lt;term&gt;light&lt;/term&gt;, to distinguish them from those which I
call &lt;term lang=&quot;la&quot;&gt;fructifera&lt;/term&gt;, experiments of
&lt;term&gt;fruit&lt;/term&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now experiments of this kind have one admirable
property and condition:  they never miss or fail. ...&lt;/p&gt;</pre>


 </p>
<p>
<a name="id2757612"></a>When more than one writing system is used for the same
human language in a given document, it may be convenient to supply more than one
<a name="GDX-117"></a><b><tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt></b> element, each of which will have an identifier
derived from ISO 639, extended by an appropriate suffix.
For example, a text containing material in Old Bulgarian, some parts of which use
Cyrillic script, while other parts use Glagolitic script, might define
a <a name="GDX-118"></a><b><tt>&lt;langUsage&gt;</tt></b> element like the following:
<pre class="eg">&lt;langUsage&gt;
&lt;language id=&quot;OBG-CYR&quot;&gt;Old Bulgarian, written in Cyrillic script.&lt;/language&gt;
&lt;language id=&quot;OBG-GLA&quot;&gt;Old Bulgarian, written in Glagolitic script.&lt;/language&gt;
&lt;!-- other languages used or referenced in the manuscript description --&gt;
&lt;/langUsage&gt;
</pre>
With these declarations in force, the language and writing system
appropriate to any section of the text may be marked explicitly:
<pre class="eg">&lt;div lang=&quot;OBG-GLA&quot;&gt;
&lt;head lang=&quot;OBG-CYR&quot;&gt;....&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
Note that the language applicable to any element is inherited from its
parent by default: in the above example, therefore, each element
within the <a name="GDX-119"></a><b><tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt></b> element not specifying otherwise is assumed to
be written in Old Bulgarian using Glagolitic script. The <a name="GDX-120"></a><b><tt>&lt;p&gt;</tt></b>
element shown above thus uses Glagolitic, while the <a name="GDX-121"></a><b><tt>&lt;head&gt;</tt></b>
element uses Cyrillic.</p>

<p>
<a name="id2757702"></a>Note that in general glyph distinctions are not specified by these
Guidelines; if the glyphs to be used for a given encoded character are
not available, application software may choose to display the material
in an appropriate transliteration, as entity references,
or in some other way.  </p>

<p>
<a name="id2757714"></a>If a formal writing system declaration is supplied it will be
specified by the <tt><b>wsd</b></tt> attribute on the <a name="GDX-122"></a><b><tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt></b>
element concerned (see further <a class="ptr" href="CH.html#CHWS">4.4 The Writing System Declaration</a>).</p>

<p>
<a name="id2757749"></a>Any XML document may use an additional attribute
<tt><b>xml:lang</b></tt>, the value of which is the identifier of a
language from ISO 639 or registered with IANA. According to the XML
Recommendation, the scope of this attribute is &#8216;considered to apply
to all attributes and contents of the element where it is specified,
unless overriden with an instance of xml:lang on another element
within that content.&#8217; (XML Recommendation, 2.12). Since the TEI DTD
defines a great number of <tt>CDATA</tt> attributes with predeclared content in
English, <tt><b>xml:lang</b></tt> cannot be used by TEI documents as
intended in the XML recommendation.  The current version of these
Guidelines does not recommend use of the <tt><b>xml:lang</b></tt> attribute
as a means of indicating language shifts; the TEI global
<tt><b>lang</b></tt> attribute should instead be used for this purpose. This
recommendation will be reviewed at the next revision of these
Guidelines.</p>

<h4>
<a name="CHWS"></a>4.4  The Writing System Declaration</h4>
<p>A Writing System Declaration (WSD) may be used to supply formal
documentation for any language and writing system used in a
document additional to that implied by its encoded form. It 
is particularly useful for documentation of non-standard encodings or
transliterations. A WSD specifies:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a formal name for the writing system and language
</li>
<li>a specification for the meaning of each character available
in the writing system</li>
</ul>
<p>
The  characters available in a writing system may be specified in the
WSD for that writing system in one or more of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>by reference to an international, national, or TEI-registered coded
character set or entity set</li>
<li>by reference to such a standard followed by formal declaration of
all exceptions</li>
<li>by providing a formal declaration for each character used</li>
</ul>
Individual characters within a WSD are formally declared, where
necessary, by providing the following information:
<ul>
<li>the unique code used to represent the character</li>
<li>special properties such as whether the character is a diacritic
mark or not</li>
<li>brief textual description of the character</li>
<li>standard or local entity name used for the character in

<a name="id2757981"></a>The writing system declaration is one of a set of
<a name="TDX-184"></a><em>auxiliary</em> documents which provide documentation relevant to
the processing of TEI texts.  Auxiliary documents are themselves SGML or XML
documents, for which document type declarations are provided.  The DTD
for the Writing System Declaration is discussed in detail in chapter <a class="ptr" href="WD.html">25 Writing System Declaration</a>.
Example Writing System Declarations may be obtained as described
in chapter <a class="ptr" href="XW.html">37 Obtaining TEI WSDs</a>.
